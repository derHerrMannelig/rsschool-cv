## About myself
My journey as a programmer started at my university, ONAT (currently SUITT/SUITC). During these years of diligent learning I have developed the passion of tackling complex tasks using analytical skills and logic thinking, combined with cooperative and communicative flexibility. I can describe myself as a fast learner and a person always open to something new.
